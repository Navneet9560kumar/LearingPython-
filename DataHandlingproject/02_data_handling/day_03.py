# In the lecture titled "Day 3 Personal Movie Tracker with JSON," the instructor introduces JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as a flexible data representation format, similar to how data is organized in Excel or CSV files. The focus is on creating a Python command-line tool for managing a personal movie database, which is stored in a JSON file.

# Key points include:

# Each movie entry has three fields: title, genre, and rating (out of 10).
# Functionalities include adding movies, viewing all movies, searching by title or genre, and preventing duplicate entries.
# The instructor demonstrates how to work with JSON data in Python using the built-in JSON module, covering loading, saving, and ensuring effective data handling.
# Error handling is emphasized, especially regarding duplicate titles and user input validation.
# Practical coding examples are provided, illustrating how to develop functions for managing movie entries and efficient data retrieval with list comprehensions.
# The lecture concludes with a demonstration of the completed movie tracker tool and encourages learners to experiment with the code while highlighting modular programming practices for better software development.
